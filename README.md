Hello and welcome to my personal reposity :) This will contain my tests and works using Python, R, SQL and another tools.

Project MonitorSpace.py
- This is was requirement which my team in Kyndryl had. There is a spacemonitor tool developed by IBM which creates a report with the required information about IMS databases. This report is designed to run under Mainframe systems and it does not have a interface so friendly and spreadsheet tools like Excel or PowerBI are not able to filter and use it. 
So I created a Python code which can open a txt file direct downloaded from Mainframe and modifies the report so we can have a friendly view and more able usage for Power Bi and Excel. This is in place in Kyndryl and we are using as much we update the Power BI graphs.
